bio: 
During my Ph.D in the Renmin University of China, my research focus on the few body problems in the Ultracold atomic system. After that , I moved to my present location CQRT of the university of oklahoma as a postdoctoral research associate and works on the spinor BEC system both in theoretical and experimental aspects.  In one project, I investigated the performance of a SU(1,1) interferometer for different classes of initial states. My theoretical work has practical implications for experiments with spinor BECs and I have been collaborating effectively with experimentalists at OU.
I also interest in the non-equilibrium phenomenons, like many body localization, in the cold atom systems.


interests:
- Few body problems in cold atom systems
- Spinor BEC, both in theory and experiment sides
- Many body localization
- Quantum metrology
